# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
Poisture Petection
 poseture detection using machine learing and deep learning 
 well, let me tell you some breif about this project 
 in this project we are not trainihg the model, it is front end based project 
 here you need two libraries.
 ### 1. p5.js 
 <img src="https://github.com/sahilsaqi/poseture-detection" width="250" alt="My cool logo"/>
 (p5.js) is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free and open-source, you can read more through this link  'https://p5js.org/'.
 ### 2.ml5.js
 ml5.js is an open source, friendly high level interface to TensorFlow.js, a library for handling GPU-accelerated mathematical operations and memory management for machine learning algorithms, you can read more on  'https://ml5js.org/'
## step 1:
open desktop and  make a folder by renaming (PoseNet).

## Step 2:
open visual studio code and open the previous folder which you made on desktop (poseNet)


## step 3:
create a file by naming (index.html)

## step 4:
create another file by naming (sketch.js)

## step 5:
copy the my code and paste it respective files and run it 

## demo on github is here
